#summary Corporate POM.

= Introduction =

Corporate POM centralizes projects configuration:

  * Plugin versions.
  * Plugin configuration.
  * Global properties for plugins.
  * Distribution management settings
  * Reporting configuration

= Build Setup = 

Corporate POM build setup should be configured as Continuous Integration build plan. After every commit Corporate POM artifact will be deployed into the snapshot repository. Use the following command in the build plan: 

{{{
mvn clean deploy
}}}

= Release Setup =

Corporate POM release setup should be configured as Continuous Integration build plan. The build strategy can be set as manual build (on demand) or scheduled build (related to Scrum iteration for example).

Use the following command in the build plan:

{{{
mvn --batch-mode release:prepare release:perform
}}}

The next release version can customized by `releaseVersion` property:

{{{
mvn --batch-mode release:prepare release:perform -DreleaseVersion=1.0
}}}

The next release version can customized by `releaseVersion` property:

{{{
mvn --batch-mode release:prepare release:perform -DdevelopmentVersion=2.0-SNAPSHOT
}}}

TODO: use release:branch instead of release:prepare

= Update Corporate POM References =

The following command updates Corporate POM version to the latest release:

{{{
mvn versions:update-parent
}}}

If your project refers to the Corporate POM which has not been released yet (not recommended):

{{{
mvn versions:update-parent -DallowSnapshots=true
}}}
