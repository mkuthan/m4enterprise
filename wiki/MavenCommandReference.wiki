#summary Maven Command Reference

= Introduction =

The document is Maven build commands reference. It is organized with sections, each section for one build aspect. For commands details please refer to the Maven or Maven plugins documentation.

= Project Build =

Clean a project:

{{{
mvn clean
}}}

Run unit tests:

{{{
mvn test
}}}

Build a package (it also executes unit tests):

{{{
mvn package
}}}

Run integration test (it also builds a package):

{{{
mvn verify
}}}

Install a package into local repository (it also executes integration tests):

{{{
mvn install
}}}

= Dependency Management =

Check dependencies for newer versions:

{{{
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
}}}

Check plugins for newer versions:

{{{
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
}}}

Check for newer versions defined as properties:

{{{
mvn versions:display-property-updates
}}}

Display project dependencies:

{{{
mvn dependency:tree
}}}

Analyze project dependencies:

{{{
mvn dependency:analyze
}}}

= Project Site =

*Notice:*

  For modular Maven projects all modules must be installed in the local repository before site generation. [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MJAVADOC-116 Bug] in the Maven Javadoc Plugin is a root cause of this restriction.

Generate site without tests reports (tests are not executed):

{{{
mvn site:site
}}}

Generate site with unit tests reports:

{{{
mvn test site:site
}}}

Generate site with unit and integration tests reports:

{{{
mvn verify site:site
}}}

Generate site stage with valid links between project modules:

{{{
mvn site:stage
}}}

Generate site without reports (like Javadocs):

{{{
mvn site -DgenerateReports=false
}}}

= Code Coverage =

For the code coverage report commercial tool Clover is used. To generate report the Clover licence must be purchased. 

Generate clover reports (customize Clover licence file location):

{{{
mvn -Dmaven.clover.licenseLocation='c:\_data\clover.licence' clover2:setup verify clover2:aggregate clover2:clover
}}}
